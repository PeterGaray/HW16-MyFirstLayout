<!-- nice start 

Make sure you indent your 2 <section>s properly.

When applying background (which you have done i a class, that's ok), don't give it exact measurements such as width/height.
When you give it width, which is the maximum size of the browser window on a large screen resolution, you might run into the issue that you can also scroll the screen horizontally. Google chrome applies default small margins.
To get rid of those margins you might want to do:
body{
  margin: 0px;
}

in the beginning of the css file.

Instead of adding width and height to your background, you can just add padding-bottom: YourNumberInPixels; to the background class so it is larger than the inside content.

+1 for working github and great folder and file structure.

might want to include <title>PageName</title> in your <head></head> so it's not named index.html in the tab :)
good work
